	<p>As an archaeological site, it is worth noting of a village by the name Sutton Passeys whose last traces dates back to 1558 have long since become extinct. The village was on the Radford side of the Wollaton Park. Sutton Passeys has long been wholly decayed and now only known as Wollaton parke (Kenyon, 2005). The Wollaton Park is studded by many fine oak trees of which some may have probably been planted during the construction of the hall by Sir Francis Willoughby while others portray the signs of their antiquity. The British wild white cattle herd was relatively in recent times kept but currently, it is position has been taken by both herds of fallow and red deer. Wollaton hall lies in such a salient landscape being a fine possession of Sir Francis Willoughby ancient family (Kenyon, 2005).</p>
